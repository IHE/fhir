Appendix W: Implementation Material

Implementation material for some IHE profiles can be found on the IHE FTP site under ftp://ftp.ihe.net/TF_Implementation_Material/.

FHIR conformance resources (e.g. StructureDefinition, CapabilityStatement, ValueSet, etc) for some IHE profiles can be found in either the “fhir” folder on the above FTP site, or can be found on the IHE controlled “fhir” GitHub repository found at https://github.com/IHE/fhir.

Implementation material is non-normative and includes schema, examples, WSDL, FHIR conformance resources, and more.
