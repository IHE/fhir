Files related to the definition of IHE profiles that depend on HL7 FHIR

The GitHub repository https://github.com/IHE/fhir is used for management and formal publication of FHIR conformance resources by IHE. The IHE FTP site is an alternate place where the conformance resources are published. The IHE FTP site is no longer used for management of conformance resources, any conformance resources placed on the IHE FTP site that are not managed on this github repository will be deleted. When this repository is updated, it will be reflected onto the IHE FTP site. 

Updates to this repository must be done by creating a branch pull-request. All branch pull-requests must be reviewed by the IHE workgroup that owns the IHE Profile for which the conformance resources belong. Review by the workgroup should assure that the resulting branch would be valid using the HL7 FHIR Validator tool or Implementation Guide publication tool.  All approvals must be by formal motion and recorded in the pull-request branch.

FHIR Conformance resources are non-normative.
