# IHE FHIR Conformance Resources
This repository is the formal publication location for IHE Profiled FHIR conformance resources (e.g. StructureDefinition, CapabilityStatement, ValueSet, etc).

Updates to this repository must be done by creating a branch pull-request. All branch pull-requests must be reviewed by the IHE workgroup that owns the IHE Profile for which the conformance resources belong. Review by the workgroup should assure that the resulting branch would be valid using the HL7 FHIR Validator tool or Implementation Guide publication tool.  All approvals must be by formal motion and recorded in the pull-request branch.

Issues may also be logged in this repository for issues related to the conformance resources within. Formal change proposals may be needed if the issue is related to normative text.

FHIR Conformance resources are non-normative, the normative specification are the supplement or technical framework text.

Note the movement to other publication methods is in progress.

Format Code vocabulary is published at http://profiles.ihe.net/fhir/ihe.formatcode.fhir/
MHD is now published as an Implementation Guide at http://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/MHD/
